I feared that something had happened to you. Where have you been all the time?"</p><p>"I took my four friends, the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare, up into the hills, and there I made them try a wrestling match, to see which was the strongest. We all enjoyed the sport, and are going to the same place to-morrow to have another match."</p><p>"Now tell me who is the strongest of all?" asked his mother, pretending not to know.</p><p>"Oh, mother," said Kintaro, "don't you know that I am the strongest? There was no need for me to wrestle with any of them."</p><p>"But next to you then, who is the strongest?"</p><p>"The bear comes next to me in strength," answered Kintaro.</p><p>"And after the bear?" asked his mother again.</p></div> </div>
