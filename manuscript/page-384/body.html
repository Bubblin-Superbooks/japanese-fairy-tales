Your goodness to me has been higher than the mountain grasses which it was your daily work to cut, and deeper than the river where my mother washes the clothes. I do not know how to thank you enough."</p><p>"Why," answered the old man, "it is a matter of course that a father should bring up his son. When you are older it will be your turn to take care of us, so after all there will be no profit or loss between usâ€”all will be equal. Indeed, I am rather surprised that you should thank me in this way!" and the old man looked bothered.</p><p>"I hope you will be patient with me," said Momotaro; "but before I begin to pay back your goodness to me I have a request to make which I hope you will grant me above everything else."</p><p>"I will let you do whatever you wish, for you are quite different to all other boys!"</p></div> </div>
