She was sixty years of age, yet in all her life she had never seen such a big peach as this.</p><p>"How delicious that peach must be!" she said to herself. "I must certainly get it and take it home to my old man."</p><p>She stretched out her arm to try and get it, but it was quite out of her reach. She looked about for a stick, but there was not one to be seen, and if she went to look for one she would lose the peach.</p><p>Stopping a moment to think what she would do, she remembered an old charm-verse. Now she began to clap her hands to keep time to the rolling of the peach down stream, and while she clapped she sang this song:</p><p>"Distant water is bitter,<br>The near water is sweet;<br>Pass by the distant water<br>And come into the sweet."</p></div> </div>
