I don't know how to do it," said the perplexed jelly fish.</p><p>"This is what you must do," said the wily chief steward. "When you approach the Island of Monkeys and meet some of them, you must try to get very friendly with one. Tell him that you are a servant of the Dragon King, and invite him to come and visit you and see the Dragon King's Palace. Try and describe to him as vividly as you can the grandeur of the Palace and the wonders of the sea so as to arouse his curiosity and make him long to see it all!"</p><p>"But how am I to get the monkey here? You know monkeys don't swim?" said the reluctant jelly fish.</p><p>"You must carry him on your back. What is the use of your shell if you can't do that!" said the chief steward.</p><p>"Won't he be very heavy?" queried kurage again.</p><p>"You mustn't mind that, for you are working for the Dragon King," replied the chief steward.</p></div> </div>
