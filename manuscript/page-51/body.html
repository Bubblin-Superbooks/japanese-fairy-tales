<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>"Look here, boys, you are treating that poor tortoise so badly that it will soon die!"</p><p>The boys, who were all of an age when children seem to delight in being cruel to animals, took no notice of Urashima's gentle reproof, but went on teasing it as before. One of the older boys answered:</p><p>"Who cares whether it lives or dies? We do not. Here, boys, go on, go on!"</p><p>And they began to treat the poor tortoise more cruelly than ever. Urashima waited a moment, turning over in his mind what would be the best way to deal with the boys. He would try to persuade them to give the tortoise up to him, so he smiled at them and said:</p><p>"I am sure you are all good, kind boys! Now won't you give me the tortoise? I should like to have it so much!"</p><p>"No, we won't give you the tortoise," said one of the boys. "Why should we? We caught it ourselves."</p></div> </div>
