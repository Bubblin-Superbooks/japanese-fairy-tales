The deer rubbed his horns against a tree for pleasure, the monkey scratched his back, the hare smoothed his long ears, and the bear gave a grunt of satisfaction.</p><p>Kintaro said, "Here is a place for a good game. What do you all say to a wrestling match?"</p><p>The bear being the biggest and the oldest, answered for the others:</p><p>"That will be great fun," said she. "I am the strongest animal, so I will make the platform for the wrestlers;" and she set to work with a will to dig up the earth and to pat it into shape.</p><p>"All right," said Kintaro, "I will look on while you all wrestle with each other. I shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round."</p><p>"What fun! we shall all try to get the prize," said the bear.</p></div> </div>
