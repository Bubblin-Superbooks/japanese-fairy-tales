I am one of the servants of the Dragon King. I have heard so much of your beautiful island that I have come on purpose to see it," answered the jelly fish.</p><p>"I am very glad to see you," said the monkey.</p><p>"By the bye," said the jelly fish, "have you ever seen the Palace of the Dragon King of the Sea where I live?"</p><p>"I have often heard of it, but I have never seen it!" answered the monkey.</p><p>"Then you ought most surely to come. It is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it. The beauty of the Palace is beyond all descriptionâ€”it is certainly to my mind the most lovely place in the world," said the jelly fish.</p><p>"Is it so beautiful as all that?" asked the monkey in astonishment.</p></div> </div>
