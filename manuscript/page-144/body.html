<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>"You, Sentaro, are fond of good living and of every comfort. You are not even like an ordinary man, for you are exceptionally idle, and more sensitive to heat and cold than most people. You would never be able to go barefoot or to wear only one thin dress in the winter time! Do you think that you would ever have the patience or the endurance to live a hermit's life?"</p><p>"In answer to your prayer, however, I will help you in another way. I will send you to the country of Perpetual Life, where death never comesâ€”where the people live forever!"</p><p>Saying this, Jofuku put into Sentaro's hand a little crane made of paper, telling him to sit on its back and it would carry him there.</p><p>Sentaro obeyed wonderingly. The crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort. It then spread its wings, rose high in the air, and flew away over the mountains right out to sea.</p></div> </div>
